# Welcome!
This is a repository exclusively for decoding ciphers! The language used to solve these ciphers is Java. There will soon be a website available where you can decode without having to use the code yourself!

*Currently in progress of being edited as some of the code do not function as intended*

<h1>Additional info on Ciphers</h1>
<h3 id="vigenere">Vigenere Cipher</h3>
<ul>
  <li>a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution. (wikipedia)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ceasar">Ceasar Cipher</h3>
<ul>
  <li>one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques; a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. (wikipedia)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="a1-z26">A1-Z26 Cipher</h3>
<ul>
  <li>its number in the alphabet replaces each alphabet letter -> A=1, B=2, ... , Z=26</li>
</ul>
