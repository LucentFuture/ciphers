# What ciphers are what?
- Vigenere Cipher: a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution. (wikipedia)
- Ceasar Cipher: one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques; a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. (wikipedia)
