# Welcome!
This is a repository exclusively for decoding ciphers! The language used to solve these ciphers is Java. There will soon be a website available where you can decode without having to use the code yourself!

# Additional info on Ciphers
- Vigenere Cipher: a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a series of interwoven Caesar ciphers, based on the letters of a keyword. It employs a form of polyalphabetic substitution. (wikipedia)
- Ceasar Cipher: one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques; a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. (wikipedia)
- A1-Z26 Cipher: its number in the alphabet replaces each alphabet letter -> A=1, B=2, ... , Z=26
